# Manual Hosts File Configuration
# Use this as an alternative to dnsmasq for simpler setup
# 
# Instructions:
# 1. Find your laptop's IP address:
#    Windows: Open PowerShell and run: ipconfig
#    Look for "IPv4 Address" under your WiFi adapter
#    Example: 192.168.1.100
#
# 2. Edit the hosts file on each device that needs access:
#    Windows: C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts
#    Linux/Mac: /etc/hosts
#    
# 3. Add this line (replace with your actual IP):
#    192.168.1.100  finsight.local www.finsight.local
#
# 4. Save the file (requires administrator/root privileges)
#
# 5. Test by pinging: ping finsight.local

# Example entries (replace 192.168.1.100 with your laptop IP):
192.168.1.100  finsight.local
192.168.1.100  www.finsight.local
192.168.1.100  api.finsight.local
192.168.1.100  nagios.finsight.local
